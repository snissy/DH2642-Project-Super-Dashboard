##### Before you start code
Before you start to code. Create a issue on the issue page and desribe what you are aiming to solve or fix. Create a new branch for each issue.
Name your branch after your issue, see the naming template below. By creating an issue that describes a change, you make it easy for the rest of the team to understand what you are working on

Remember to document the code that you write, it could be the case another teamember has to rewrite or add code to what you have written. 
This process can be alot smother if there are good documentation in place. 

Do not write gigantic issues, this could lead to merge hell. Try to merge as often as possible. Try to split up your work in smaller steps that do not change to much of the main branch. Make commitments often and try to keep them clear and not so scattered.

##### Branch naming template

#[issueNr]-[Feat/Fix/Doc/Refac]-[Title]-[Author]

##### Commit template
#[issueNr]-[Feat/Fix/Doc/Refac]-[Title]

The title should be with an active voice, eg. write "This fixes so that the css properly show when you hover over an element." 
"...it’s plain to see that writing in the passive voice should be avoided wherever possible. Active voice immediately identifies both the action and who or what is performing the action, adding clarity and precision to your words."

##### Pull Requests
Make a pull request when you think you are done with your task. It's good if two other members review the pull requsest before you merge. You can ask for this in the pull request. Close the issue that correnspond to the issue to be solved.
